#+TITLE: n-body-box

Playground for playing with WebGL, Node-Webkit and ClojureScript.

Under construction.  Hard hats required.  Pointy bits everywhere.  Use
at your own risk.  YMMV.  Do not try this at home.  Professional
driver, closed course.  Consumption of =n-body-box= may cause hives,
itching, dizzyness and spelling errors.

* Work in progress.
** Create node-webkit project
** Create cool splash screen
(lame, I know, but it's my project, dammit)
** Create cool icon
(ditto)
